# MEAN Music

Hosted in cloud, __real cloud__, but still empty http://meanmusic-zhakhalov.rhcloud.com/


###Project Idea
Create platform for listening and sharing audio content (music) with elements of social network.
Mobile app for standalone work as player and integration with web app.

Requirements:

* Collaborative content management: each user can add and modify audio content
* Public and private playlists and libraries
    * User can create private playlists 
    * User can create public playlists
    * User can update public playlists, if it is allowed by author.
    * Private songs (Do not share)
* All files stored on file sharing hosting [Mega.nz](http://mega.nz) without using cloud application disc space
* Stream audio as bytestream w/o implicit file extension direct from file sharing hosting
* Create service as Single Page Web Application
* Security _based on hacks of analogue products :D_
* Prevent downloading of files, except private and uploaded by user.
* Offline work with cached files up to few hundreds MB.
